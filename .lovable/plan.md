# 🖥️ Bhavya's macOS-Inspired Portfolio

A dark-mode, glassmorphic, Gen-Z portfolio that looks and feels like a macOS desktop — with draggable/clickable "app windows" as cards, a dock bar for navigation, and recruiter-friendly content presentation.

---

## 🎨 Design & Theme
- **Dark macOS Sonoma aesthetic** — deep dark background with subtle gradient mesh/noise texture
- **Glassmorphism cards** — frosted glass effect with backdrop blur, subtle borders, and glow accents
- **macOS-style dock** at the bottom for navigating between sections (About, Experience, Projects, Skills, Achievements, Resume, Contact)
- **Window-style cards** with traffic light dots (red/yellow/green) in the top-left corner, mimicking macOS windows
- **Smooth animations** — cards fade/slide in on scroll, hover effects with depth
- **Fully responsive** — dock converts to a mobile-friendly bottom nav; cards stack vertically on small screens
